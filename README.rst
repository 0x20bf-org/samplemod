setup.py (for humans)
=====================

This repo exists to provide an `example setup.py <https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py/blob/master/setup.py>`_ file, that can be used to bootstrap your next Python project. 

``setup.py`` files can be daunting to approach, when first starting out — even Guido has been heard saying, "everyone cargo cults thems". It's true — so, I want this repo to be the best place to copy–paste from :)
